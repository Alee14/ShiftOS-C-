# ShiftOS C# Rewrite

This is an effort to rewrite the ShiftOS codebase from pre-open source 0.0.9 in C#.

## To-do:

 - Finish ArtPad
 - Finish menu skinning
 - Test out more Modding API features
 - Fix Process Management features (modding API stuff)

Please update this section with things that you are doing. Just put what you're doing, and what your username is, and other devs won't mess things up until you're done.

## Documentation and Tutorials

Check the Wiki (the little document sign on the side of the bitbucket page)

# CAUTION!

Please do NOT modify or remove ANY .vb files. They are from the old codebase, and will be converted to C# to preserve older applications and features without fully rewriting them. You may delete the .vb and .Designer.vb files of any application you've converted to C#.
